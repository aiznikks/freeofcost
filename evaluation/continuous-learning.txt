	•	Took initiative to deepen understanding of model conversion techniques, post-training quantization, and profiling using tools like onecc and Netron.
	•	Regularly explored new frameworks and formats (e.g., ONNX, TFLite, SavedModel) to stay ahead of platform changes and model deployment requirements.
	•	Learned through hands-on experiments, studying open-source repositories, analyzing real failures, and revisiting internal documentation when tackling new model types.
	•	Applied learnings immediately — leading to more efficient conversions, quicker issue resolution, and broader model support.
	•	Shared discoveries with peers via reusable scripts and informal walkthroughs, contributing to the team’s overall knowledge pool.
	•	Developed a habit of learning while delivering, which helped me take ownership of more complex and less-documented tasks over time.
