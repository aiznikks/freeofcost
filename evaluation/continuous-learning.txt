I approached this year with a strong commitment to learning beyond my immediate responsibilities. While actively working on model conversion and profiling workflows, I consistently explored new frameworks, tools, and SDK updates to stay ahead of changes — including adapting to dynamic/static model formats, new post-training quantization methods, and advanced debugging with Netron and onecc.

Beyond the hands-on work, I invested time in studying internal documentation, reading open-source implementations, and reverse-engineering unfamiliar model types to understand how different architectures behave across hardware backends. These learnings directly translated into better conversion strategies, reduced profiling failures, and faster delivery.

I also shared knowledge with teammates through documentation, reusable scripts, and on-call walkthroughs, reinforcing a culture of technical growth within the team. This habit of continuous learning didn’t just help me solve problems — it expanded my capacity to take on more complex, cross-domain tasks confidently.
