Subject: TensorFlow Model Conversion – Process and Script

Hi [Manager’s Name],

As requested, I’ve started working on converting the remaining benchmark models in TensorFlow. Below is the full process I’m following, along with the script used for converting the models to TFLite format with full INT8 quantization.

⸻

Model Conversion Process (to TFLite with Full INT8 Quantization):
	1.	Load the TensorFlow SavedModel
Load the .pb or SavedModel format using TFLiteConverter.
	2.	Enable Optimizations
Apply default optimization settings to enable post-training quantization.
	3.	Provide Representative Dataset
This is required for calibrating the model during INT8 quantization. I’m using randomly generated data matching the model’s input shape.
	4.	Apply Full INT8 Quantization
Specify that both weights and activations should be quantized. Input and output types are also set to uint8 to match typical NPU requirements.
	5.	Convert and Save the Model
The converted model is saved in .tflite format.

Script Used for Conversion:

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# 1. Load SavedModel directory (replace with actual model path)
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model("saved_model_dir")

# 2. Enable optimizations
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]

# 3. Define representative dataset
def representative_data_gen():
    for _ in range(100):
        dummy_input = np.random.rand(1, 224, 224, 3).astype(np.float32)  # adjust shape as needed
        yield [dummy_input]

converter.representative_dataset = representative_data_gen

# 4. Set full INT8 quantization
converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS_INT8]
converter.inference_input_type = tf.uint8
converter.inference_output_type = tf.uint8

# 5. Convert and save
tflite_quant_model = converter.convert()

with open("model_int8.tflite", "wb") as f:
    f.write(tflite_quant_model)

print("INT8 quantized TFLite model saved as model_int8.tflite")

Please let me know if there are any specific models you’d like me to prioritize or if any variations are needed for input shapes or quantization parameters. I’ll continue with the conversions and keep you updated.

Best regards,
