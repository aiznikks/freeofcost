You are analyzing a complex multi-board C/C++ + Python codebase where a runtime error
`Tensor dimensions mismatch` occurs inside `fill_tensor` (Utils.h).

Your task is NOT to fix the bug directly.

Your task is to **collect and consolidate all critical information required to debug this issue into ONE SINGLE MARKDOWN FILE**.

Create a file named:

DEBUG_TENSOR_MISMATCH_DUMP.md

and populate it with the following sections, in this exact order.

---

## 1. Board Selection Logic
- Identify where the target board is selected (STANDARD / KANTSU2E / others).
- Mention file names, functions, and conditions used.
- Explain how this selection affects tensor creation or weight loading.

---

## 2. Tensor Creation Summary (Runtime View)
For each layer in execution order:
- conv1
- conv2
- conv3
- flatten
- dense0_extra
- dense0

For EACH layer, document:
- File name
- Function name
- Tensor shape as created at runtime
- Total number of elements allocated

---

## 3. Flatten Logic (Critical)
- Locate the exact code responsible for flattening.
- Explain how flatten dimensions are computed.
- State the expected flattened size.
- Mention whether this logic is board-specific or shared across boards.

---

## 4. Weight Loading Path
- Identify the exact function(s) that load `.npy` files.
- Explain how the NPY header is parsed.
- Explain how the number of elements to read is calculated.
- Explicitly state what condition triggers the `fill_tensor` error.

---

## 5. fill_tensor Function (Full Detail)
- Paste the full implementation of `fill_tensor`.
- Highlight the exact check that throws `Tensor dimensions mismatch`.
- Explain what the function expects vs what it receives.

---

## 6. Weight Files Inventory (Python Side)
For each weight and bias file:
- File name
- Shape
- Total element count
- Data type

Include:
- conv weights
- conv biases
- dense0 weights
- dense0_extra weights
- dense biases

---

## 7. Mismatch Hypothesis
Based strictly on the above data:
- Identify which tensor is most likely mismatched.
- Explain WHY the mismatch occurs.
- State whether the issue is:
  - wrong flatten size
  - wrong tensor allocation
  - wrong file read count
  - board-specific logic mismatch

---

## Constraints
- Do NOT assume missing files.
- Do NOT skip code references.
- Do NOT fix anything yet.
- Everything must be traceable to a file and line number.
- All output must go into **DEBUG_TENSOR_MISMATCH_DUMP.md only**.

---

Goal:
After this file is generated, a human should be able to diagnose the bug
without searching the codebase again.
