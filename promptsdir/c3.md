Before making any further fixes, determine whether KANTSU2E weight files are
expected to be:

A) Derived from another board’s weights (with a defined transformation), or
B) Generated independently based on KANTSU2E runtime architecture.

Search the codebase and documentation for:
- comments
- scripts
- historical commits
- naming conventions

If option A:
- Document the exact transformation logic and where it is implemented.
- State which board is the source of truth.

If option B:
- Identify where independent KANTSU2E weight generation should occur.
- Explain why reusing other boards’ weights is invalid.

Output findings with file references.
Do NOT modify code.
