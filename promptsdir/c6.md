Stop attempting to fix the issue.

Your ONLY task is to ADD TEMPORARY DEBUG LOGS to expose the exact tensor mismatch.

Context:
Runtime crashes with `Tensor dimensions mismatch` inside `fill_tensor`.

Task:

1. Modify `fill_tensor` to PRINT the following before the mismatch check:
   - Tensor name
   - Tensor shape (all dimensions)
   - Total tensor element count
   - Number of elements read from the `.npy` file

2. Ensure logs print in this format (example):
   ---
   [DEBUG][KANTSU2E]
   Tensor name: dense0_extra_weight
   Tensor shape: [?, ?, ?, ?]
   Tensor elements expected: X
   NPY elements read: Y
   ---

3. Also add logs where:
   - Flatten tensor is created
   - Dense tensors are allocated
   Print computed flatten size and dense input size.

4. Do NOT change logic.
5. Do NOT suppress errors.
6. Only add logs and rebuild.

Goal:
When the crash happens, the log must clearly show X vs Y so a human can see the mismatch immediately.
