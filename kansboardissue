Context:
We are generating custom weight (.npy) files for the Samsung kants2ue board.  
The model graph builds successfully on the board, but crashes at runtime with a tensor dimension mismatch error (SIGABRT).

Observed Issue:
- Weights load without file-level errors.
- Runtime fails during execution with "tensor dimensions mismatch".
- This indicates a mismatch between expected tensor layout/shape on the kants2ue runtime and the generated weights, not file corruption.

What needs to be done:
1. Verify the **exact weight tensor layout expected by the kants2ue runtime**:
   - Conv weights order: confirm whether runtime expects  
     (out, height, width, in) instead of (out, in, height, width).
   - Fully connected (dense) weights: confirm whether runtime expects  
     (out_features, in_features) or transpose of standard NumPy format.

2. Confirm the **flattened tensor size before the dense layers**:
   - The flatten output size from conv + pool layers must exactly match
     the input dimension of dense0 / dense0_extra.
   - Any mismatch here causes runtime SIGABRT.

3. Confirm **NPY compatibility requirements**:
   - Supported .npy version (e.g., v1.0 only).
   - Endianness and float32 requirement.
   - Whether runtime uses a custom NPY loader with strict assumptions.

Expected Outcome:
- Final confirmation of:
  - Correct conv weight transpose order.
  - Correct dense weight transpose.
  - Exact expected input size for dense layers.
- Once these contracts are aligned, the runtime tensor mismatch should be resolved.

This is a runtime contract mismatch issue, not a Python-side generation failure.
